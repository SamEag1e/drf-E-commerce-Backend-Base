# 📦 Archived Project - DRF E-commerce Backend Base

> This repository is **archived** and was part of my effort to build a reusable backend foundation for future e-commerce projects.  
> It reflects my growing experience with Django REST Framework and secure, modern authentication workflows.

## 🚀 Overview

This project served as a backend skeleton for scalable e-commerce systems, with a focus on clean architecture and modular development. It includes:

- 🔐 **JWT + OTP Authentication** – Secure, password-less login using JSON Web Tokens and one-time passwords.
- 👤 **User Accounts CRUD** – Registration, login, and profile management functionality.
- 💬 **Comments CRUD** – Feature for managing user-generated comments on products or services.
- 🛠️ **Model-based CRUD Patterns** – Reusable and consistent CRUD logic across multiple apps.

## ⚠️ Status

While core models were implemented, only selected modules like `users` and `comments` had completed CRUD endpoints.  
Features such as products, orders, and payment integration were **still in development** at the time of archiving.  
Further development continued in a **private repository**, refining the architecture for production use.
